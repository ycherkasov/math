\section{Комбинаторика}

\subsection{Перестановки}

For example, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). One might define an anagram of a word as a permutation of its letters. 

$$
A_n^m=\frac{n!}{(n-m)!} 
$$

The number of permutations of n distinct objects: \\

$$
P_n=A_n^n=n!=1\cdot2  \dots \cdot n
$$

\subsection{Сочетания}

Combination is a way of selecting several things out of a larger group, where (unlike permutations) order does not matter \\
Permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3) are {\bfseries equial} \\

$$
C_n^k = {n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!\left(n-k\right)!}
$$
